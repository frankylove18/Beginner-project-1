        <h2><u> POSITION OF THE HEART </u></h2>
        <img src="heart.jpg" style="width: 350px; height: 450px; float: right; background-attachment: fixed;">

            <pre>
            The heart is situated almost in the middle line in the thoracic cavity between the lungs.
            Its lower conical part is tilted towards the left.
            Heart is enclosed in the bony thoracic cage formed by backbone, ribs, breast bones and diaphragm.
          </pre>
        </p>

        <h3> SHAPE AND SIZE</h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
            The heart is hollow, muscular and cone-shaped organ.
            It is about the size of a fist and weighs about 300gm in a man, and 250g in a woman.
            It meaures up to 12cm in length and 9cm in width.
            </pre>
        </p>

        <h3> PERICARDIAM</h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
                The heart is enclosed ina membrane called <u>pericadium</u>
                They are formed up of two layers : <u>Fibrous Pericardium</u> and <u>Serous Pericardium</u>
                
                1. Fibrous Pericardium : It is tough , loosely fitted and inelastic sac around the heart.
                                         It is made up of white fibrous tissue.
                                         It prevents from excessive expansion of heart.
                
                2. Serous Pericardium  : It is formed of two thin layers.
                    (i)  Parietal Layer which forms the lining of the fibrous pericadium.
                    (ii) Visceral Layer(epicardium) forms the outer layer of heart.
                
                There is a pericadial space between the parietal and visceral layers which 
                is filled with pericardial fluid.

            The human heart is four chambered.
            It consits of two auricles and two venticles.

            Auricles : These form small upper part of the heart.
                       Externally, these are demarcated from the venticles by <i><u>coronary sulcus</u></i>.
            
            Ventricles : These form the largest part lower part of the heart.
                         Externally, two ventricles are markes by an obliques <i><u>interventricular sulcus</u></i>.
                         
            There are three types of Sulci(grooves) :
            1. <i>Coronary sulcus</i>: It is an irregular transverse groove divides heart into anterior auricular part 
             and posterior ventricular part.
            2. Internal groove divides atrium into right and left atria.
            3. <i>Interventricular Sulcus</i>: It is an oblique longitudinal groove on the ventral side
             of ventricular part.

            <h3> AURICLES </h3>

            Thin walled chambers separated by a thin interventricular(interatrial) septum.
            Lying in the septum is an oval depression, the <i> fossa ovalis </i>.

            1. Right Atrium : 
                    
                  It is thin walled chamber and is lager than the left atrium.
                  A muscular pouch like <i>auricular appendage</i>. It recieves openings of superior vena cava,
                  inferior vena cava and coronary sinus.
                  Right atrium opens into right venticle by right atrioventricular aperture.

            2. Left Atrium :
               
                It is smaller than right atrium and has thicker walls.
                The pouch-like extension frtom its lower edge is called <i>auricular appendage</i>.
                It has opening of four pulmonary veins.
                Left atrium opens into left ventricle by left atrioventricular aperture.

         <h3> VENTRICLES </h3>

          These are thick walled lower chambers of heart.
          It is separated from each other by an obliquely placed interventricular septum.

               (i) The right venticle pumps deoxygenated blood to pulmonary
               arteries which supply blood to the lungs.
               (ii) The left ventricle pumps oxygenated blood to aorta which supplies
               blood to all over the body.
         
         The right atrium and left atrium is gaurded by two valves namely :
          <b><i>Tricuspid valve</i></b> and <b><i>Bicuspid(Mitral) valve</i></b>

            1. Right Atrium: It recives two veins - Superior and anterior vena cava.
                             i. The superior vena cava brings deoxygenated blood from 
                             the upper region of the body.
                             ii. The inferior vena cava brings deoxygenated blood from
                             the lower region of the body.
            
            2. Left Atrium: It recives two pairs of pulmonary veins-one from each side.
                            These brings oxygenated from lungs and have no valves.
                           
            3. From the right ventricle arises pulmonary aorta.It carries deoxygenated
                   blood to lungs.
              
            4. From the left ventricle arises systemic aorta.The aorta arch supplies 
                   oxygenated blood to all parts of the body,except lungs.

            During each heartbeat, 
            the heart chambers
            relax and contract
            in a 
            specific sequence.

            The contraction and
            relaxation is 
            known as 
            diastole and systole.
         </pre>

        <h3> CARDIAC CYCLE </h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
            The sequence of completion of one heartbeat is called cardiac cycle.
            During, the cycle, the following events occurs:
            1. Jiont diastole
            2. Auricular systole
            3. Auricular diastole
            4. Ventricular systole
            5. Ventricular diastole

            1.Joint Diastole : During this phase,blood continues to flow into the auricles filing blood in pulmonary veins and atria.
                It is about 0.4s duration. Nest heartbeat starts with the auricular systole.
            
            2.Auricular Systole : When full of blood, the auricles pumps the blood to their respective
                venticleswhich are still in diastole.
                It is about 0.1-.015s duration.
                
                (i) During atrial systole, the bicuspid and tricuspid valves open for the flow of blood to the 
                    respective ventricles.
                (ii) Blood does not flows back as the roots are compressed for backward flow.
               
            3. Auricular Diastole : At the end od systole, the auricles(atria) return to diastole and starts
                                    relaxing.
                                    
            4. Ventricular Systole : With the onset of atrial diastole, the ventricles starts to contract.
                     At this time the blood gushes in, and the tricuspid and bicuspid valve closes sharply giving a "LUBB"
                     sound.
                     The semilunar valves of the great aorta and pulmonary artery opens, then blood is pumped into the great arteries.
                     It is about 0.3s duration.
                     
            5. Ventricular Diastole : At the end of ventricular systole, ventricles starts to contract.
                  At this time, the semilunar valves closes sharply to prevent the back flow of blood and thus causes
                  the "DUBB" sound.
                  
          Joint Diastole = 0.4s |  Atrial Systole = 0.1s |  Ventricular Systole = 0.3s

        <h3> HEART RATE AND PULSE RATE </h3>
        <p>
            <pre>

            1. Heart Rate:
                  
                 Human heart beats 72times per minute in resting condition.
                 Newborn infants heart beats 130times per minute.

            2. Pulse Rate:
            
                Beating of heart is felt in the arteries asd regular jerks or throbs.
                Each ventricular systole starts a new pulse.
                The pulse rate is same as that of heart rate.
         </pre>
        </p>
        <h3> HEARTBEAT </h3>

        <h2><u> CARDIO VASCULAR DISEASES </u></h2>
        <h3> 1. Hpertension(High Blood Pressure) </h3>
        <img src="hypertension.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 250px; float: right; background-attachment: fixed;">
        <p>
            <pre>
             In this case the blood pressure remains above 140/90mm Hg.
             It is seen in more than 10 per cent of middle aged persons.
             Persistent anxiety, excitement, anger or any other emotional stress leads to hypertension.
             Arterioscleroisis and Atheroma are two diseases responsible for hypertension.
             
             <b>Effects Of Hypertension:</b>
                     High blood pressureis a silent killer.
                     It damages arteries and their capillaries.
                     In kidney, this causes:
                                            (i)   Chronic nephritis.
                                            (ii)  In eyes, it leads to blindness.
                                            (iii) In brain, this may cause stroke.
         </pre>
        </p>
        <h3> 2. Coronary Artery Diseases </h3>
        <p>
            <pre>
            I. Angina Pectoris(Heart Block):
            <img src="anginapectoris.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 150px; float: right; background-attachment: fixed;">
            It is a sharp pain in the heart and chest that radiates into the left arm.
            The pain is usually in the centre of the chest and is accompanied by a feeling of suffocation,
            dizziness, and palpitation.

            Due to narrowing or blocked coronary arteries, the cardiac muscles do not get enough oxygen.
            Deprived of sufficient oxygen leads to constricting of muscles.
            The angina pain initially passes but is a warning of heart attack.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 

            II. Heart Attack: It may be caused for two reasons-
                 
                (a) Artherosclerosis :
                <img src="artherosclerosis.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 150px; float: right; background-attachment: fixed;">
                          This is narrowing of coronary artery or any branch due to accumulation
                          of fatty substances such as cholestrol on the inner lining of ther 
                          arteries. 
                          This forms the yellow deposit called <i>artheroma</i>.
                          The frequent deposit of artheroma in the blood capillary prevents
                          the flow of blood thus narrowing of coronary artery.Hence, leads to
                          heart attack called artherosclerosis.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br> 

                (b) Coronary Thrombosis :  
                <img src="coronarythrombosis.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 150px; float: right; background-attachment: fixed;">
                          In this case, a blood clot or thrombus is formed in some parts of 
                          cornary artery, which either reduces or cuts off the blood supply 
                          to a part of heart muscles.
                          It is more frequent to those roughened surfaces formed due to
                          breakdown of artheroma.

                          In total blockage of a branch of coronary artery,the part of 
                          cardiac muscles getting some blood supply from other branches,
                          fails to slupply the blood.This is known as myocardial infraction.
